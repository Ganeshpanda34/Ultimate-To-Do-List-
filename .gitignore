#      Professional .gitignore for Modern Web Development
#
# This file is carefully curated to ensure the repository remains
# clean, secure, and focused on source code. It prevents common
# generated files, sensitive data, and environment-specific
# configurations from being committed to version control.

# Dependency directories
# Although this project currently uses CDNs, this is a best practice
# for any future dependency management (e.g., via npm or yarn).

# committed instead to show what variables are needed.
